        p1              :Source for filter1 (lucid -> lucid parse tree(pt))
                                          i.e. checks for syntax errors.
        p2              :Source for filter2 (lucid pt -> lucid pt)

	evaluator	:Source for the lucid evaluator
        manual          :lucid programming manual/UNIX manual entry

Installing pLucid
================

 In directory p1 change the fourth line of file main.c to your install
 directory. It is currently:
   
     #DEFINE INCDIR "/usr/local/bin"

 Then run:

     make

 Then run:

     make install

 The default install location is /usr/local/bin and can be changed
 by giving an optional prefix paramter to make install e.g:

     make install prefix=/home/bin
